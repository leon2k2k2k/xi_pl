I am almost finished with this. 

Let's write some more test to make sure everything is good:

for each test, I need to add both py/js, reg/dereg. 
Also everything is async:
this is written in Aplite



test 0:
let var_0 = 5

result:
js_to_js: good, ofc.
py_to_js: works
js_to_py: works.
py_to_py: yes!!!.

test 1:
let var_1 = lambda|x : Int| x + 5
console_log(var_1 (10))

test 2:
let var_2 = lambda|f : Int -> Int| f(1000)
console_log(var_2 (var_1))
